# *Pointless*

Pointless is a really small static website generator for 9front. It allows you to embed `<exec>` tags on templated HTML files that contain interpreted code (shell or a language of your choice) that gets executed as the file is preprocessed. `pointless/generate` also contains hooks for scripts that get executed before and after the templated HTML is preprocessed, allowing you to generate files on-the-fly or cleanup the directory tree after preprocessing is done.

## TODO

- Usage
- this readme sucks
- etc
